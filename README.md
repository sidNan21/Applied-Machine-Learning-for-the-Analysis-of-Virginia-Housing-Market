# Applied Machine Learning for the Analysis of Virginia Housing Market

## Abstract

In recent years, rising income and wealth inequality have become a topic of national debate prompting increasing questions about sustainable and affordable housing for the many people whose stagnant wages have not kept up with rising costs. Recent political events and increased participation in socioeconomic movements protesting the growing income disparity have had public policy officials and leaders in the tech industry unite to look for a solution. In our project for CS 4501: Machine Learning, we attempt to investigate the underlying market factors that influence the pricing of houses in Virginia as well as discern critical differences in housing markets nationwide using several Machine Learning techniques. The full paper, *Applied Machine Learning for the Analysis of Virginia Housing Market*, is available in this repository in addition to the code/data used for the analysis.
